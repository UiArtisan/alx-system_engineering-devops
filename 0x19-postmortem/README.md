# 0x19. Postmortem

A postmortem, in the context of software development or system operations, refers to a formal process of analyzing and documenting an incident or outage that occurred within a system or service. It's akin to a medical postmortem examination where the cause of death is determined after the fact.

In the tech world, a postmortem serves several purposes:

1. **Understanding the Incident:** It aims to understand what went wrong, why it happened, and its impact on the system or service.
2. **Identifying Root Causes:** It helps in identifying the underlying issues or root causes that led to the incident.
3. **Learning Opportunities:** Postmortems provide learning opportunities for the team involved, helping them understand how to prevent similar incidents in the future.
4. **Improving Processes:** By analyzing the incident, teams can identify areas for process improvement, whether it's in monitoring, communication, or system resilience.
5. **Communication:** Postmortems serve as a communication tool, ensuring that all stakeholders are aware of what happened, why it happened, and what steps are being taken to prevent recurrence.

Typically, a postmortem document includes sections such as:

- **Issue Summary:** A brief overview of the incident, including its duration, impact, and affected services/users.
- **Timeline:** A chronological sequence of events leading up to and during the incident, including how it was detected, actions taken, and escalations.
- **Root Cause and Resolution:** An in-depth analysis of what caused the incident and how it was resolved.
- **Corrective and Preventative Measures:** Recommendations for preventing similar incidents in the future, including tasks to address identified issues.

Overall, postmortems are crucial for fostering a culture of learning and continuous improvement within technical teams, ensuring that incidents are not only resolved promptly but also serve as opportunities for growth and resilience.
